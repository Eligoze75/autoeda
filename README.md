Overview

AutoEDA is a lightweight Python package designed to automate the most common and time-consuming steps of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Given a pandas DataFrame, AutoEDA quickly surfaces data quality issues, statistical summaries, and meaningful visualizations to help data scientists and analysts understand their data before modeling.

## Get started

You can install this package into your preferred Python environment using pip:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

TODO: Add a brief example of how to use the package to this section

To use autoeda in your code:

```python
>>> from autoeda.inspect import get_unary
>>> get_unary(df)
```

## Core Functionality

AutoEDA provides a set of modular functions that can be used independently or combined into a full EDA workflow:

- `inspect` module

  - `get_unary(df, threshold=0.75, dropna=False)` Identifies columns dominated by a single value beyond a configurable frequency threshold. This helps detect near-constant or low-information features that may be candidates for removal.

  - `get_high_cardinality(df, max_unique_ratio=0.5)` Identify columns with high cardinality. This helps detect features that may be unsuitable for certain modeling techniques or require special encoding.

- `get_summary_df(df)`  
Generates a comprehensive summary table including data types, descriptive statistics, counts, and missing value information for both numerical and categorical features.

- `check_na_outliers(df, outlier_method="auto", ...)`  
Diagnoses missing values and potential outliers across columns, optionally assigning qualitative risk levels and actionable suggestions for preprocessing steps such as imputation or transformation.

- `plot_correlation_heatmap(df, target=None, method="pearson")`  
Computes and visualizes correlations between numeric features using a heatmap, with optional emphasis on correlations involving a target variable.

- `plot_histograms_by_target(df, target, features=None)`  
Plots feature distributions conditioned on a target variable, making it easier to inspect class separation, skewness, and feature behavior across outcomes.

## Positioning in the Python Ecosystem

AutoEDA sits in the space between low-level EDA utilities and fully automated profiling tools. Several existing libraries provide overlapping functionality:

- [pandas-profiling (renamed as ydata-profiling)](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/)

    Generates exhaustive HTML reports but can be heavy, slow on large datasets, and less customizable in programmatic workflows.

- [Sweetviz](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz)

    Focuses on visual comparisons and reporting, primarily for reporting.

- [D-Tale](https://github.com/man-group/dtale)

    Provides an interactive UI for EDA, but is less suited for scripted pipelines or reproducible analysis.

**AutoEDA** differentiates itself by offering:

- Simple, composable Python functions (not monolithic reports)
- Interpretable diagnostics and suggestions
- Tight integration with pandas and matplotlib/seaborn
- A focus on EDA as code, suitable for notebooks, scripts, and production pipelines
