# Contributing

We welcome any input, feedback, bug reports, and contributions to the **AutoEDA** package. This project aims to be a lightweight Python package designed to automate the most common and time consuming steps of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Your contributions can help us:

- Improve functions performance and usability
- Incorporate additional features
- Refine visualizations
- Expand documentation

All contributions, suggestions, and feedback you submit are accepted under the [Project's license](LICENSE). You represent that if you do not own copyright in the code that you have the authority to submit it under the [Project's license](LICENSE). All feedback, suggestions, or contributions are not confidential.

## Example Contributions

You can contribute in many ways, for example:

- [Report bugs](#report-bugs)
- [Fix Bugs](#fix-bugs)
- [Implement Features](#implement-features)
- [Write Documentation](#write-documentation)
- [Submit Feedback](#submit-feedback)

### Report Bugs

Report bugs here -> [issues](https://github.com/Eligoze75/autoeda/issues).

**If you are reporting a bug, please follow the template guidelines. The more
detailed your report, the easier and thus faster we can help you.**

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything labelled with `bug` and
`help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. When you decide to work on such an issue, please assign yourself to it and add a comment that you'll be working on that, too. If you see another issue without the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the maintainers are usually happy for any support that they can get.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything labelled with
`enhancement` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. As
for [fixing bugs](#fix-bugs), please assign yourself to the issue and add a comment that
you'll be working on that, too. If another enhancement catches your fancy, but it
doesn't have the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the maintainers are usually
happy for any support that they can get.

### Write Documentation

AutoEDA could always use more documentation, whether as
part of the official documentation, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog
posts, articles, and such. Just
[open an issue](https://github.com/Eligoze75/autoeda/issues)
to let us know what you will be working on so that we can provide you with guidance.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at this link
[AutoEDA issues](https://github.com/Eligoze75/autoeda/issues). If your feedback fits the format of one of the issue templates, please use that. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project and everybody has limited time.

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up AutoEDA for
local development.

1. Fork the https://github.com/Eligoze75/autoeda repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally (*if you want to work locally*)

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/autoeda.git
    ```

3. [Install hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/).

4. Create a branch for local development using the default branch (typically `main`) as a starting point. Use `fix` or `feat` as a prefix for your branch name.

    ```shell
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b fix-name-of-your-bugfix
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, apply the quality assurance tools and check
   that your changes pass our test suite. This is all included with tox

    ```shell
    hatch run test:run
    ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub. Please use [semantic
   commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix: summarize your changes"
    git push -u origin fix-name-of-your-bugfix
    ```

7. Open the link displayed in the message when pushing your new branch in order
   to submit a pull request.

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, ensure that:

1. **Your code runs without errors**: Test all modified modules and functions
2. **Dependencies are documented**: Update `requirements.txt` if you add new packages (TBC)

### Creating a Pull Request

Provide a clear title and detailed description of your changes: - What problem does it solve? - What are the key results or improvements? - Are there any limitations or concerns?

Your PR will be reviewed, and you may receive feedback or requests for changes.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. We expect all participants to:

- Be respectful and considerate in communications
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully

## Questions and Discussions

If you have questions or want to discuss ideas before contributing:

- Open an issue with the `question` or `discussion` label
- Reach out to the maintainers
- Share your ideas and get feedback before investing significant time

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **AutoEDA**. Every suggestion, bug report, or enhancement no matter how small helps improve the quality, usability, and reliability of this package.

By contributing, you are helping make exploratory data analysis more accessible, nicer, and less time consuming for data scientists and analysts. Together, we can build better tools that support clearer insights and stronger data driven decisions.

We truly appreciate your time and effort in supporting this project.
